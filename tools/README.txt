This subdirectory ('tools') contains modules and scripts for
maintaining the code that is autogenerated from the upstream
GSW-Matlab and GSW-C repos.  The scripts are to be run from
this directory; they may make assumptions about where they
are, and about where upstream repos are.

Scripts
-------
- copy_from_GSW-C.py: copies the relevant .c and .h files from a
    sibling GSW-C repo, if the latter are newer.
- make_ufuncs.py: Generates the src/_ufuncs.c file to turn the
    scalar C functions into numpy ufuncs.  It writes ufuncs.list
    in the current directory as a record of the ufunc names.
    Functions are identified as ufunc candidates based on their
    signatures, parsed from src/c_gsw/gswteos-10.h.
- make_wrapped_ufuncs.py: Generates gsw/_wrapped_ufuncs.py based on
    the output of make_ufuncs.py.
- mat2npz.py: generates an npz file in gsw/tests containing the
    test data and check values from the gsw_data_v3_0.mat file
    in the sibling GSW-Matlab repo.

Modules
-------
- c_header_parser.py: Functions for taking apart the function
    declarations in gswteos-10.h.
- matlab_parser.py: Functions specifically for reading the GSW-Matlab
    function signatures and for splitting out the help text.
- docstring_parts.py: Blocks of text for assembling docstrings.
- docstring_utils.py: Functions for assembling docstrings in numpydoc
    format.
- categories.py: Functions for listing gsw function names by category.
    This is not used by any of the other functions or scripts, but
    was used when initially categorizing the functions for inclusion
    in submodules.
