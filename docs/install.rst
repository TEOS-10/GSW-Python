Installation
============

If you have cloned the github repository, you can change directory to the
cloned repo and install with pip::

    pip install .

The ``gsw`` package is available from the Python Package index::

    pip install gsw

Both of the methods above require building from the source code, so you will
need an appropriate build environment.

For most people, we recommend using the
`miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__ Python distribution,
and then installing a binary package from conda-forge::

    conda install -c conda-forge gsw
